TDD PROJECT The system will be developed using the TDD method. A particular factory is approaching you with the goal of creating a tracking management system for employee salaries. Requirements: Absorption of a single employee by manually entering the employee's details. Automatic entry of 10,000 employees into the system (random). Issuing an employee report in a sorted manner according to the employees' salaries. Employee income tax calculation is selected from the list.

Data for each employee will be: ID. Name. Last Name. Email. phone. Address. Monthly salary (randomly between 3,000 and 50,000).

We will create the SORT function as bubble sort (n2) and then improve the code to a more efficient code (execution time of less than n2 using quick sort).
